Daily Adventure Specifications

Synopsis:

	Imagine you have a normally active/hectic day, full of tasks, appointments, meetings, busy traffic, loads of errands, etc.  
  At the end of the day, when you’re putting the kids in bed…or catching up with your spouse…you go back over that list and 
  find that – while there was a lot, it doesn’t sound as exciting and hectic as it was when you were doing it.
	
  What if you slanted the events in such a way to make them more of an adventure story?

	Daily Adventure can do that for you!

	Point DA at your Calendar, your Messenger, your Facebook account, your Twitter account, then at the end of the day, 
  it will recast all your accomplishments into something you can present to the world as an adventure itself!

	DA even allows you to set the framework of that adventure into your favorite story genre – if you’re a fan of Zane Grey, 
  you’ll find you’re the local sheriff having to hold off the cattle rustlers until the cavalry comes – or you rescued your 
  side-kick from being held by bandits.  Fancy Heinlein?  You’re now the plucky young hero or heroine who’s discovered a 
  discarded space suit with a message for help from a distant world.  Or if you’re a fan of Danielle Steele, it’s you and 
  your best friend shopping in Monaco when the handsome stranger comes into your life with a rather odd request…

	But DA doesn’t stop there…why not enlist your friends on social media to add their daily stories into your own?  
  Even if your slant is romance and theirs is horror, your results get fit into each other’s daily or on-going saga.

	DA will even take the results and post them back into your social media outlets for you – either as links to your own 
  hosted “novel”, or synopsized down to fit the bill.

	Turn your daily grind into a daily epic with Daily Adventure!
